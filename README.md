Hi! I wanted to send you an apple.
But, here, apples don't ripen till October... : (

I have my eyes on a specific fruit, on this old apple tree in our backyard. The tree's been around since I was a kid, and its fruits were always the sweetest!
Yet, we have to wait for them to ripen... 

Here, you can watch the daily progress of the little applet.

It couldn't really fit inside the screen, so I sliced it down to the cellular level; I took a tiny tissue sample and put it under a toy microscope (no apples harmed in the process). Then I used those images to generate more 'cells' to simulate a cellular progress bar. Of sorts.

As the days pass and the apple grows and ripens, the cells will slowly gather towards the center. Over time, they will turn gradually redder, leaning into the colour that is already showing on the apple's skin; All until it's ready to be harvested. Snippets describing its progress float at the bottom of the screen. 


Oh, and I made a lullaby to play to the applet. They say plants grow best when you make an effort to entertain them.


You can visit the applet whenever you want. 
You can leave it open in the background and listen to the lullaby in anticipation of the fruit. 
You can use it as a part of your patience-building practice. 
.. Or as a Rorschach test?


But still, we will have to wait. And isn't that very slowness of acquiring that we all need today?



Well, until October, then!
