Hi!

I wanted to send you an apple.


But, here, apples don't ripen till October... : (


I do have my eyes on a specific fruit, on this old apple tree at the end of my street.
The tree's been around since I was a kid and it was always the sweetest!


Yet, we have to wait... 


BUT, you can still watch the progress of the applet.


It couldn't really fit inside the screen, so I sliced it down to a cellular level;
I took a tiny tissue sample under a microscope (no apples harmed in the process)
and used the images to simulate a cellular progress bar. Of a sort.


You can visit the applet whenever you wish. You can leave it in the background and listen to it in anticipation. 
You can use it as a patience-building practice. As a Rorschach test..?




Well, until then!
