### Hi! ### 

I wanted to send you an apple! 

But, here, apples don't ripen till October... : (

I do have my eyes on a specific fruit, on this old apple tree at the end of my street.
The tree's been around since I was a kid and it never left me feeling hungry!

Yet, we have to wait... 

I came to my hometown to de-tech, bearing no tools: 
not my sensors, not my boards, not my modules, not my instruments.. 
not even my mouse! <3 )~

So I can't do much to help entertain the pass of time.

BUT, 
I can send you updates on the progress of our little applet.

I can't fit the whole thing inside the screen, so I brought it down to molecular level;
I took a tiny tissue sample under a microscope - No apples harmed in the process! -
and simulated a cellular progress bar... Of a sorts.

You can visit your applet whenever you wish. : )



So, see you in October, I guess!
