### Hi!

I wanted to send you an apple! 


But, here, apples don't ripen till October... : (


I do have my eyes on a specific fruit, on this old apple tree at the end of my street.
The tree's been around since I was a kid and never left me hungry!


Yet, we have to wait... 


I came to my hometown to de-tech, bearing no tools: 
not my sensors, not my boards, not my modules, not my instruments.. 
Not even my mouse! <3  )~


So I can't do much to help entertain the passing of time.


BUT, 
I can update you on the progress of our little applet.


I can't fit the whole thing inside the screen, so I brought it down to the cellular level;
I took a tiny tissue sample under a microscope - no apples harmed in the process! -
and simulated a cellular progress bar. Of a sort.


You can visit your applet whenever you wish. : )



So, we'll see you in October, I hope!
