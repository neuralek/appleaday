Hi! 

I wanted to send you an apple - but, here, apples don't ripen till October... : (

I already have my eyes on a specific fruit, on this old apple tree in our backyard. The tree's been around since I was a kid, and its fruits were always the sweetest!
Yet, we have to wait for them to grow... 


You can watch the daily progress of that little applet, though.


It couldn't really fit inside the screen, so I sliced it down to the cellular level; I took a tiny tissue sample and put it under a toy microscope, then used those images to generate more 'cells' to simulate a cellular progress bar. Of sorts.

As the days pass and the apple grows and ripens, the cells slowly gather towards the center. Over time, they will turn gradually redder, leaning into the colour showing on the applet's skin; All until it's ready to be harvested. 
Snippets describing its progress float at the bottom of the screen.


Oh, and I made a lullaby to be played to the applet. They do say plants grow best when you make an effort to entertain them.


You can visit the applet whenever you want. 
You can leave the lullaby open in the background and listen to it in anticipation of the fruit. 
You can use it as a part of your patience-building practice.. 
.. Or as a Rorschach test?


But still, we will have to wait. And isn't that very slowness of acquiring what we all lack today?




Well, till October, then.
